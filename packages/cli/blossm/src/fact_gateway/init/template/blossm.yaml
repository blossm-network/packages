# Each fact can be accessed by adding the URL path /<name> to the base URL.
#
# The 'priviledges' property describes the priviledges needed by the requester
# to access this fact. Set this to 'none' if no specific priviledges are needed,
# but the route should still require by a valid token.
#
# Set the 'protection' property to 'none' if this route should be accessible by
# anyone on the internet. Set 'protection' to 'context' if the route should be
# accessible by anyone on the internet, but if a valid token is used, then
# the request context should be parsed from it and passed along to the fact.
