# This file is required.
# Specify which domain your event store for, write it's schema, and specify what it should be indexed by.
#
# How to write a schema -> https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html
# Types and validators should always be specified,
# and default values and required flags should be set if intended.
#
# How to write indexes -> https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#indexes
# Queries to the store that aren't indexed will be rejected.
# In other words, full collection scans are not allowed.
