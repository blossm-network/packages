#
# Give your view-composite a unique name, and specify which context it's in. Optionally add the
# domain and service.

name: some-name
domain: some-optional-domain
service: some-optional-service
context: some-context

# Add dependencies and devDependencies, just like a package.json file.

# The following properties are used for automated testing.
#
testing:
  #
  # Add network dependencies that will be used when running integration tests.
  #
  # You can include any standard blossm procedure thats within your network
  # by specifying 'procedure', 'service', 'domain', 'context', and 'name' properties.
  # These procedure within your network that are included in dependencies will run
  # during integration test based on the latest published image.
  #
  dependencies:
    - name: some-name
      domain: some-domain
      service: some-service
      context: some-context
      procedure: view-store

  #
  # Add each integration test you want to run as a 'step'.
  #
  # The 'pre' property is an array of instructions that allow you to set up the view state
  # of the system before the integration test runs. For example, you can add a view to
  # an view-store by setting the 'name', 'domain', 'service', and 'context' properties to
  # those of the view-store that you want to modify the state of, 'root' and 'action' to the root
  # and action that describe the event, and 'payload' to the payload of the event that is
  # being added.
  #
  # The 'query' property is the query that should be used in this integration test step.
  #
  # The 'context' property is the context that should be used in this integration test step.
  # Leave it out if no context should be passed in.
  #
  # The 'root' property is the domain root that should be used in this integration test step.
  # Leave it out if there is no relevant domain root.
  #
  # The 'response' property is the response body that is expected to be returned.
  # If the expected value of a response property is not known ahead of time, leave
  # it's value empty.
  #
  # The 'code' property is the response code that is expected to be returned.
  # If a 'response' is provided, this defaults to 200.
