This service is a simple example of how to set up Blossm procedures to build a chunk of functionality.

Here's the spec we're going for that will shed light on all the basics:
* Anyone can create a `home` and create `tasks` that roommates in the `home` can complete. 
* The creator of the `home` has admin privileges allowing them to invite new roommates.
* When a `home` is a created, there is a default `task` created to "Throw a party".

The example is complete with unit tests and integration tests. You should be able to take what's here and deploy it without trouble, and use it for reference when putting together your own app.
