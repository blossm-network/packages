This service is a simple example of how to set up Blossm procedures to build a chunk of functionality.

Roommates can create a `home` and create `tasks` that anyone in the `home` can complete. The creator of the `home` has admin privileges allowed them to invite new roommates.

The example is complete with unit tests and integration tests. You should be able to take what's here and deploy it without trouble, and use it for reference when putting together your own app.
