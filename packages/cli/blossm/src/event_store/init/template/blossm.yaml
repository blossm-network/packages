#
# Specify which domain and service your event-store is for.
#
domain: some-domain
service: some-service

#
# Specify whether the data in this view store should be publicly readable.
#
public: false

# Specify the actions that this event-store can handle.
actions:
  - some-action

#
# Give your event-store a schema.
#
# Schemas are Mongo-esque.
# How to write a schema -> https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html
# Types and validators should always be specified,
# and default values and required flags should be set if intended.
#
schema:
  name: String

#
# Specify how this event-store can be indexed.
#
# How to write indexes -> https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#indexes
# Queries to the store that aren't indexed will be rejected.
# In other words, full collection scans are not allowed.
#
# Queries can only be issued against indexed properties.
#
# Indexes options are not supported.
#
indexes:
  - name

#
# The following properties are used for automated testing.
#
testing:
  #
  # Add tests for your handlers here.
  #
  # The 'action' property specifies which handler is being tested.
  # The 'examples' property is an array of instructions
  # with 'state', 'payload', and 'result' properties.
  #
  # The 'state' property specifies the state of the aggregate before
  # the event is applied. The 'payload' property specifies the event payload,
  # and the 'result' property specifies the expected state once the event is applied.
  #
  # You can omit the 'state' and 'result' properties if the event payload entirely
  # overwrites the state of the aggregate.
  #
  handlers:
    - action: some-action
      examples:
        - state:
            name: some-name
          payload:
            name: some-other-name
          result:
            name: some-other-name

  #
  # Add at least two examples of events that can be used to test the
  # aggregation functionality of the store.
  #
  # 'action' must be an action that specified in the handlers.js file.
  #
  # Feel free to add more events to test your handler outcomes.
  #
  examples:
    first:
      action: some-action
      payload:
        name: some-name
    second:
      action: some-action
      payload:
        name: some-other-name
